# Google Apps Script Project

## Description
 
This project is developed using **Google Apps Script** and serves as a tool to visualize SoloQ performance data for various teams. It collects and displays critical statistics such as **Win Rate (WR)**, **Kills/Deaths/Assists (KDA)**, **Gold Per Minute (GPM)**, and several other performance metrics, which can be used to analyze how well different teams are performing in SoloQ.

This tool is especially useful for teams aiming to improve their coordination and strategy in SoloQ, as it provides them with valuable data that can inform training and pre-game decisions.

The application includes functionalities such as data manipulation, custom configuration, and more.
